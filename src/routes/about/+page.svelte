		<p>Seers is composed of a cohesive group of engineers who joined forces in 2022. 
		They have built a strong professional bond through years of collaboration in the Web3 industry and their shared academic experiences. 
		The team comprises individuals with distinguished qualifications, including holders of PhD degrees, former Googlers, and winners of programming Olympiads.

		<p>
			The founder of Seers has over 3 years of experience developing web3 software and more than 10 years of experience in web software development. 
			He began his web3 journey as a Rust Core Dev, contributing to the development of Polkadot alongside Gavin Wood (Ethereum co-founder). 
			Additionally, he has an extensive academic background, having worked as a PhD student specializing in the development of algorithms and proving complexity theorems in the area of Automata for Concurrent Program Verification.

			The world is saturated with information. But with this fortune comes a dilemma: It’s hard to know which information is true. Whether we like it or not, all information is created by individuals, and individuals are inherently biased. But short of a crystal ball, how does one make decisions informed not by ego but by truth?
The answer lies in data. Time and again, data has proven there is wisdom in crowds— that the many are smarter than the few, and can more precisely predict true outcomes. When a crowd is incentivized to share their predictions by betting on what they think will happen (not what they want to happen), bias is eliminated, and the truth follows. This method of trading, where people bet on outcomes, is called prediction markets.
</p><p>
At Seers, we use prediction markets to employ a governance model called futarchy, where participants bet on the success of proposed decisions, then the winning decisions are implemented. Unlike traditional governance structures where votes don’t always directly influence outcomes, futarchy ensures that when a decision is deemed likely to succeed, it’s put into practice — without the influence of bias.
</p><p>
Seers gives people “skin in the game” — a vested interest in the outcome of a decision. Because they don’t just stand to profit from betting on the truth… they stand to build a better, more equitable society because of it.
